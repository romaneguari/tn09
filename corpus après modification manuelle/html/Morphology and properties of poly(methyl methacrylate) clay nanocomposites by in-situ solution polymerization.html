					Poly(methyl metacrylate)/montmorillonite (PMMA)/(MMT) nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ solution polymerization of methyl methacrylate monomer in the presence of the organic modified MMT-clay. After the organic modification by ionic exchanging with amine salts, the organoclay becomes more hydrophobic and compatible then pristine clay with methyl methacrylate monomer. The modified clays are characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD). The powdered X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were employed to study the morphology of the PMMA/clay nanocomposites which indicate that the modified clays are dispersed in PMMA matrix to form both exfoliated and intercalated PMMA/modified clay nanocomposites. The thermo-mechanical properties were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gas permeability analyzer (GPA) shows the excellent gas barrier property of the PMMA nanocomposites which is in good agreement with the morphology. The optical property was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy which shows that these materials have good optical clarity, and UV resistance.

				<p>
					Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is a typical transparent amorphous polymer, which is used in various field of our daily life. PMMA has several desirable properties such as good flexibility, hard and stiff, low water absorption, and outstanding outdoor weathering. However, its poor thermal stability has limited its application. To improve the heat resistance, preparation of nanocomposite is an effective way. PMMA/clay nanocomposites offer potentials for enhancing gas barrier, and increasing thermal stability.
				</p>
				<p>
					In recent years, much attention has been paid to polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites, because of its enhanced physical, mechanical, and chemical properties when compared with those of pure polymer 
					<a name="bbib1" href="#bib1" class="workspace-trigger">[1]</a>
					, 
					<a name="bbib2" href="#bib2" class="workspace-trigger">[2]</a>
					, 
					<a name="bbib3" href="#bib3" class="workspace-trigger">[3]</a>
					, 
					<a name="bbib4" href="#bib4" class="workspace-trigger">[4]</a>
					. These unique properties of polymer/clay nanocomposites resulted from high degree of dispersion of clay in polymer matrix. There are two distinct nanostructures identified in these nanocomposites, intercalated, and exfoliated 
					<a name="bbib5" href="#bib5" class="workspace-trigger">[5]</a>
					. This can be achieved when the nanoscale silicate platelets are well dispersed by delaminating the layered silicate throughout the polymer matrices which results the so called exfoliated morphology. The exfoliated nanocomposite is more desirable than the intercalated one because of the stronger synergistic effects between polymer matrix and silicate layers 
					<a name="bbib6" href="#bib6" class="workspace-trigger">[6]</a>
					. However, it is still a challenging work to obtain the complete exfoliation of clay in polymer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Clays are hydrophilic inorganic compound whereas polymer contains hydrophobic group. Therefore, clays have to be modified by organic modifier containing both hydrophilic and long chain hydrophobic group to increase not only the interlayer spacing, but also the compatibility with polymer matrices. Moreover, clay is naturally occurring, environmentally friendly, cheap and readily available in large quantities. It is evident that polymer/clay nanocomposites can increase strength and stiffness

					Recently, radical-initiated MMA polymerization has been applied to prepare PMMA/clay nanocomposites because it is insensitive to water, air, and other impurities. The preparation of PMMA/clay nanocomposites through emulsion

					, and solution 
					<a name="bbib20" href="#bib20" class="workspace-trigger">[20]</a>
					 polymerization has been reported in the preparation of exfoliated polymer nanocomposites. In this paper, we have prepared the PMMA/clay nanocomposites by free-radical polymerization using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as initiator. Being hydrophilic by nature, pristine MMT is not suitable as the starting material for the polymer nanocomposites. Therefore, modified montmorillonite is made by quaternary ammonium salt. After the organic modification by ionic exchanging with amine salts, the organoclay becomes hydrophobic and compatible with methyl methacrylate monomer. We have discussed herein the effect of modifying agent with different structure on the morphology and properties of the PMMA/clay nanocomposites. The morphology of these nanocomposites has been characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The thermal and gas barrier properties of these nanocomposites have been studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and gas permeability analyzer (GPA). The optical clarity is measured by UV–vis spectroscopy.

							The WAXRD patterns of PMMA/CL120-C50 and PMMA/CL120-K2 nanocomposites with 1, 3, and 5&nbsp;wt% modified clay are measured are shown in 
							<a name="bfig2" href="#fig2" class="workspace-trigger">Fig. 2</a>
							(a) and (b), respectively. For PMMA/CL120-C50 3%, there is no diffraction peek at 2
							<em>θ</em>
							=2–10°, indicating the possibility of having exfoliated nanostructure. When the amount of organoclay increased to 5%, there was a small clay peak. This implied that there is a small amount organoclay that cannot be exfoliated in the PMMA which may form intercalated nanostructure. There is no diffraction peek at 2
							<em>θ</em>
							=2–10° for PMMA/CL120-K2 nanocomposites with 1, 3, and 5&nbsp;wt% loading. It might indicate that the layered materials are dispersed well into the PMMA matrices. The modified agent K2 have more acrylic group, which can be more compatibility with monomer to lead to exfoliated nanostructure. To further investigate the clay dispersion in the polymer matrix, TEM analysis was performed, as shown in 
							<a name="bfig3" href="#fig3" class="workspace-trigger">Fig. 3</a>
							. TEM of PMMA/CL120-C50 5% nanocomposites (

The decomposition temperature of PMMA/CL120-K2 5%, at 5% weight loss, is about 56&nbsp;°C higher than the pure PMMA. The exfoliated clay layers have an efficient barrier action to reduce the permeability of the thermal current. The layered materials belong to low thermal conductivity substance, so enhance the thermal resistance of PMMA/clay nanocomposites.

The exfoliated nanocomposites of PMMA CL120-C50 5% provide an enhanced barrier-gas property because of the nanoscale dispersion of the clays in the PMMA matrix, which led to a longer pathway of oxygen. Therefore, the result is in good agreement with WAXRD and TEM image.

					<p>
						Pencil (Eagle Turquoise-T 2375) hardness test is a simple and effective technique to evaluate the anti-scratch property of the material. The pencil lead, prepared beforehand by rubbing it on fine abrasive paper (4&nbsp;0&nbsp;0), is maintained at an angle of 45° and pushed with uniform force with 1.5&nbsp;kg onto the sample, leaving either a superficial trace or causing destruction down to the substrate. Hardness is compared with the pure PMMA polymer and data are listed in 
						<a name="btbl1" href="#tbl1" class="workspace-trigger">Table 1</a>
						 (column 5). It has been observed that the hardness of PMMA/CL120-C50 nanocomposites and PMMA/CL120-K2 nanocomposites with 3&nbsp;wt% loading of clay is 3H.The anti-scratch property of the nanocomposites is much higher than that of the pure PMMA. The exfoliated nanostructure of PMMA/clay nanocomposites may be can increase the surface hardness. The layered materials belong to hard and stiff substance, so enhance the anti-scratch property of PMMA/clay nanocomposites.

The PMMA/clay nanocomposites show a slight decline in transmission in the visible light region with the increase of the clay content, the nanocomposite can still retain a high optical transmission of approximately 88%. The transparency is shown in

				<p>
					K2 and C50 are both modifying agent with length alkyl chains. The modifying agent K2 have more acrylic group, which can provide more compatibility with monomer to lead to exfoliated nanostructure. The modified CL120-K2 layers are exfoliated by PMMA chains and dispersed in the PMMA matrix, as confirmed by WAXRD and TEM characterization. The thermal stability of PMMA was increased and depended on clay loading. On the side the PMMA/clay nanocomposites retain good optical properties.
